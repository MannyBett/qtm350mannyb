    "\n",
    "This assignment evaluates your understanding of topics covered in the first two weeks of class, including binary and hexadecimal number systems, ASCII encoding, and programming language fundamentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must complete this assignment individually. While you may use available resources such as notes, books, and AI tools, you are expected to submit original work. Please acknowledge all resources used, including input from classmates and AI. If you are unsure about permissible resources or proper acknowledgement, please consult the instructor.\n",
    "\n",

By having a numerical value compared to a categorical value like the name of a color, it allows for quantitative analysis and allows for predictive modeling in image related tasks."
